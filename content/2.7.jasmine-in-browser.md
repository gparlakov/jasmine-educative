## Browser API

Up until now, we've been running Jasmine and the unit tests in a Node.js environment. That won't be enough if we are developing and maintaining a browser application.

Let's say there's a functionality in our app that relies on a browser API like [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)

> `requestAnimationFrame(callback)` is a way to tell the browser: "Hey when you are ready with the DOM calculations but before you paint that, let me have a chance to run some js (the callback)."

In the next code playground, there's an attempt to use the way we've been doing Jasmine till now. Try running it.

// code

## Breakdown example

Looking in `src/my.spec.js` there's a line `expect(requestAnimationFrame).toBeDefined();`. It tries to verify that `requestAnimationFrame` is defined.

It fails, saying: "There's no such thing as `requestAnimationFrame`, I've no idea what you are talking about!"

And no wonder because `jasmine` is running in the context of `Node.js` where `requestAnimationFrame` simply does not exist.

To run that test we need to run Jasmine in the context of a browser.

## Jasmine in browser

There is an npm package that allows running Jasmine in the context of a browser.

The library [jasmine-browser-runner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine-browser-runner) supports a variety of browsers including chrome headless which, incidentally, is what is being used in the code playground below.

// code

## Breakdown Jasmine in browser

Looking at `spec/my.spec.js` we see the exact same line `expect(requestAnimationFrame).toBeDefined();` but this time the test **passes**.

The difference is that we are running the `jasmine-browser-runner runSpecs`. It starts a browser does some magic so the tests end up in its belly and eventually get run :)

## Different tests folder

You probably noticed that the `.spec.js` file is no longer in `/src` folder and moved in the `/spec` folder. That's aligned with the default configuration of `jasmine-browser-runner`. Since the spec files do not need to be part of the browser app bundle that gets shipped to the end-user, having them in a separate folder makes sense. We don't want the users to see the tests - just the app.

This is configurable using the `spec` and `src` properties in the configuration file.

## Configuring Jasmine in the browser

Here's the order of precedence for the config file:

- If `--config` argument was provided as a command-line parameter that takes precedence e.g. `--config=my-config.json` or `--config=my-config.js`.
- If not, then `spec/support/jasmine-browser.js` is attempted.
- Finally, `spec/support/jasmine-browser.json` is attempted.

We are using `spec/support/jasmine-browser.js` because we'd like to add a specific reporter. That config file looks like this:

```js
const specReporter = require('jasmine-spec-reporter').SpecReporter;

module.exports = {
  srcDir: 'src',
  srcFiles: ['**/*.?(m)js'],
  specDir: 'spec',
  specFiles: ['**/*[sS]pec.?(m)js'],
  helpers: ['helpers/**/*.?(m)js'],
  random: true,
  stopSpecOnExpectationFailure: false,
  reporters: [new specReporter()],
  browser: {
    name: 'headlessChrome',
  },
};
```

It has similarities to `jasmine.json` we were using earlier plus some changes:

- ```js
  const specReporter = require('jasmine-spec-reporter').SpecReporter;
  ```

  This imports the `jasmine-spec-reporter` to use in the config below.

- ```js
  srcDir: "src",
  srcFiles: [
    "**/*.?(m)js"
  ],
  ```

  This configures where the app files live - we need those to be able to test them. In this case any file with a name ending with a `.js` or `.mjs` in `/src` or any of its sub-folders.

- ```js
  specDir: "spec",
  specFiles: [
    "**/*[sS]pec.?(m)js"
  ],
  ```

  These properties configure where the test files live. In this case any file with a name ending with `.Spec.js` or `.spec.js` or `.spec.mjs` or `.Spec.mjs` in `/spec` or any of its sub-folders.

- ```js
  random: true,
  ```

  Same as Jasmine - whether or not to randomize the order of execution of tests.

- ```js
  stopSpecOnExpectationFailure: false;
  ```

  Whether or not to stop the execution on the first failure or run all tests and report all failures.

- ```js
  browser: {
    name: 'headlessChrome';
  }
  ```

  Which browser to use to run the tests. Requires the system to have that browser installed and available on the `$PATH` as well as a web driver for it. Example for chrome and chrome headless - [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).

- ```js
  reporters: [new specReporter()];
  ```

  This creates a new instance of the `specReporter`, an object that conforms to the Jasmine reporter interface _(that is - it has the same methods as the standard Jasmine [ConsoleReporter](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/blob/6d31aec40ac55a8356d112bef3bac685f6c00759/lib/reporters/console_reporter.js))_. And uses that as the sole reporter.

  > Reporter is a piece of code that takes the results of a suite and presents them by logging out to the console for example. [Jasmine Reporter docs](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/custom_reporter)

- ```js
  helpers: ['helpers/**/*.?(m)js'];
  ```

  Helpers are scripts that run before the main body of tests in the context of the browser.

### Loading files in Jasmine Browser Runner

The order of loading files in the browser is:

1. The `srcFiles` are loaded and executed.
2. The `helpers` files are loaded and executed.
3. The `specFiles` files are loaded and executed\*.

_\*loaded and executed = browser downloads the javascript and executes it._

That order of execution means that the helpers can rely on the `src` files having been loaded in the browser and use them, and the `srcFiles` can rely on both `src` and `helpers` having been loaded in the browser and use them.

Example below.

// code

## Breakdown example in the browser

- The spec `spec/my.spec.js` runs a test that verifies the result of the function call is as expected.

  ```js
  expect(pageOffsetHelper()).toEqual('x:0,y:0');
  ```

- The `pageOffsetHelper` is a function declared in `spec/helpers/myhelper.js` - a "helper".

- The `spec/support/jasmine-browser.js` runs in the _`Node.js`_ process (as opposed to the helpers and spec files) and prepares a JSON object that is the Jasmine configuration.

> Now we are dealing with **2 environments**
>
> - **Node.js** process that initiates and configures Jasmine, and spins up the server (`jasmine-browser.js` runs here).
> - **Browser environment** which is where the tests actually run.

## Exercise `uppercaseSplit`

Let's try this new browser thing on. For this exercise, we'll use a function that splits strings like:

- Split `'CpuCoreCount'` to `'Cpu Core Count'`.
- Split `'AmiLaunchIndex'` to `'Ami Launch Index'`.

And the tests should make sure the above two cases are verified.

### The `uppercaseSplit` function

It follows these steps:

- Start with a string.
- Get its lowercase version.
- Iterate over each of the characters of the original and if the lowercased character in the same index is:
  - same - just copy it
  - different - copy it and add a space

#### Function is a Module

The function in `src/uppercase-split.mjs`:

- Is a javascript module ([MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), [fun article](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/)).
- The `.mjs` helps the Jasmine-Browser-Runner understand that and treat it as a module.
- The test will also be in a `.mjs` file so that it too is a module and can load other modules.
- The test file will import the app function from a special `/__src__` folder (see [jasmine browser runner source on github](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-browser/blob/main/lib/server.js#L120-L123) for details).

#### Function breakdown

The function `uppercaseSplit` can be found in `src/uppercase-split.mjs` in the code playground below. This is its breakdown:

- ```js
  /**
   * Takes a string and splits it by uppercase letter
   * @param {string} label
   * @returns {string}
   */
  ```

  This part is a [JsDoc comment](https://jsdoc.app/index.html) that adds functionality and type description.

- ```js
  export function uppercaseSplit(label) {
  ```

  This uses the `export` [keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#exporting_module_features) to let the module (aka the js file) expose this function to other modules.

- ```js
  const lowercased = label.toLowerCase(); // CpuCoreCount -> cpuCoreCount
  ```

  This line gets a lowercase version of the `label` parameter.

- ```js
  const arrayOfChars = Array.from(label); // CpuCoreCount -> ['C', 'p', 'u', 'C', 'o',....]
  ```

  This line splits the `label` string into an array of characters to enable our algorithm _(the comment shows the first part of the result)_.

- ```js
  const separated = arrayOfChars //                     space here ðŸ‘‡ and          ðŸ‘‡ here
    .map((l, i) => (lowercased[i] != label[i] ? ' ' + l : l)); // [' C', 'p', 'u', ' C']
  ```

  These two lines compare `lowercased` and `label` characters by accessing them by their index in the string and adds spaces if they are mismatched. _(the comment shows part of the result with the spaces)_

- ```js
  return separated.join('').trim();
  ```

  This line uses `join` to create a single string from the array and `trim` removes any white spaces left. Like the one before the first `C`.

#### Steps

- Use `spec/uppercase-split.spec.mjs` and replace the `pending` with your code.
- The test file is also a Javascript Module so that it can load the module containing the logic.
  > Note: your app might use a bundler (like [babel](https://babeljs.io/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)) to create a **bundle** with a traditional `js` extension - in that case, the tests would need to leverage the same bundling.
- As always - if you need a **hint** see below the code playground.
