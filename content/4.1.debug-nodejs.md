# How to Debug Node.js Unit Tests

In this lesson we'll look in a few techniques that enable and facilitate debugging like focusing on a single test, using the `console.log` and a debugger.

Debugging our unit tests is very important. There are a few techniques for doing that. 

Starting with isolating a single test and focusing on that. Jasmine provides the `fit` capability for focusing on a single test and only running it, skipping all the rest. 

```js
fit('this is the only test that will run', () => {...})
```

It works for multiple `fit`-s too. See example below.

```js
fit('this is the only test that will run', () => {...})
fit('this is the only other test that will run', () => {...})
```

Then there's the `console.log` (and its sister methods [info, table, ...](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console#methods)). It allows us to log out state and markers at various stages of the execution of our tests. Let's see an example in the playground below.

// code - using the console.log to log out various stages
// reuse some code from previous node js functions - show a undefined value breaking the string count function

Finally we can use a debugger that understands javascript debugging. That includes browsers, IDEs like VS Code, WebStorm, IntelliJ... To debug with a debugger we need to either: 

- start the Jasmine script in debug mode 

// demo browser debugging
