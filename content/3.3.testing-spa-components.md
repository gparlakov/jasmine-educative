# How to Test Single Page App Components

In this lesson we'll focus on some of the specifics of a Single Page App component and it's testing like lifecycle hooks and event handlers.

We'll be looking at class-based SPA components. [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/component-overview#creating-a-component-manually), [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-local-state-to-a-class), and [Vue](https://class-component.vuejs.org/) support such class based components.

SPA components are generally exposing lifecycle hooks (or methods) that can be used to do certain actions at certain times. For example, wait till the component is initialized (or mounted/displayed) before making a call to the API to fetch some data. And at the time of its destruction(or unmount) stop any further processing.

Examples of component lifecycle hooks from some SPA frameworks:

- [Angular docs](https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks#initializing-a-component-or-directive)
- [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount)
- [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#mounted)

## The component - ArticleComponent

For this lesson we'll use a SPA Component that displays an article like in a blog. It loads the article at the time of its initialization. At the time of its destruction it marks itself destroyed and will not show the article.

In the code playground below there's an implementation of the ArticleComponent and it's tests. Let's run them and see their breakdown below.

// code here

## Breakdown - ArticleComponent

Looking at the `src/article.component.mjs`:

- ```js
  export class ArticleComponent {
    articleId; // or props.articleId

    article;
    loading;
    destroyed;
    //...
  }
  ```

  We start by declaring the class of the component and declaring some properties in it:

  - The `articleId` is the id of the article the component is to display. This is expected to be an input (or prop) i.e. the component relies on it being there to be able to do its job. Examples: [Angular Input](https://angular.io/guide/inputs-outputs#sending-data-to-a-child-component), [React prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#rendering-a-component), [Vue prop](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/component-props.html#passing-static-or-dynamic-props).
  - The `article` will hold a reference to the article object that is going to be fetched from the `ArticleAPI`.
  - The `loading` is the property that lets us show/hide a loading spinner to the user to let them know something is afoot.
  - The `destroyed` is the property will become true when the component is being destroyed. It will be used to stop any further processing at that point.

- ```js
  articleAPI;
  userMessenger;

  constructor(articleApi, userMessenger) {
    this.articleAPI = articleApi;
    this.userMessenger = userMessenger;
  }
  ```

  - The `articleAPI` is the instance that let's us call the server API endpoint to get the article or delete it.
  - The `userMessenger` is a instance of the `UserMessenger` class that will allows show a message to the user. It can be of the `info` or `error` category using the correspondingly named method of that class.
  - In the `constructor` we populate the `articleAPI` and the `userMessenger` properties with the passed in instances.

- ```js
  async afterComponentInitialize() {
    this.loading = true;
    try {
      const article = await this.articleAPI.get(this.articleId);
      if(!this.destroyed) {
        this.article = article;
      }
    } catch {
      if(!this.destroyed) {
        this.userMessenger.error(`Could not fetch article id: "${this.articleId}". Please try again.`);
      }
    }
    this.loading = false;
  }
  ```

  This method is a "hook" that will get called by the framework (e.g. Angular or React) after the component initializes and is ready to take the data and display it. It's an `async` method which allows us to use `await` within it.

  The `this.loading = true;` line sets up the loading state so that a user will see a spinner indicating something is going on in the background.

- ```js
  try {
    const article = await this.articleAPI.get(this.articleId);
    if (!this.destroyed) {
      this.article = article;
    }
  }
  ```

  Wrapping the logic in a `try catch` to make sure if the api call throws, we catch the error and handle it (handling logic is next).

  The `this.articleAPI.get(this.articleId)` call is asynchronous (i.e. it returns a `Promise`) so we `await` it and get the response in the `article` local constant.

  If the component has been destroyed there is no point to populate the article property so we skip. This check is largely not necessary for such a straight-forward component logic. It serves to demonstrate the "do not process any more logic after the component has been destroyed" approach which serves to effectively cancel any further calculations and stop potential memory leaks. ([Memory leaks in JavaScript article](https://auth0.com/blog/four-types-of-leaks-in-your-javascript-code-and-how-to-get-rid-of-them/#Further-reading))

  In essence this check is here so we can demo how to test such logic.

- ```js
  try {
    // ... skipped
  } catch {
    if (!this.destroyed) {
      this.userMessenger.error(`Could not fetch article id: "${this.articleId}". Please try again.`);
    }
  }
  ```

  In the case of an error returned from the server (400 or 500) we expect the `Promise` will get rejected so we handle that case. Handle it by showing relevant information to the user and potentially how they can resolve this situation.

  Again, this logic is wrapped in a check if the component has been destroyed. This is to handle a case similar to:

  - User opens the article.
  - Spinner appears.
  - Response takes a lot of time and spinner stays on.
  - User closes the article component (e.g. navigates back).
  - Component gets destroyed at this time.
  - Response arrives after that and is an error (500).
  - Showing and error at this time will be confusing for the user which is in a different context now e.g. the article list page. Hence the check if the component has been destroyed before showing the error.

- ```js
  beforeComponentDestroy() {
    this.destroyed = true;
    this.article = undefined;
  }
  ```

  This is the "hook" that gets called by the framework at the time of component destruction is about to happen. After this call the framework (e.g. Angular or React) will remove the component from the DOM and discard it.

  We mark this component instance as `destroyed` and also discard any `article` object the component might hold reference to resetting it.

## Breakdown - tests

We will test the two "hook" methods. There's a new challenge for the tests: The "hook" `beforeComponentDestroy` method changes the behavior of the `afterComponentInitialize` while the `afterComponentInitialize` is still being processed.

Let's look at `spec/article-component.spec.mjs`:

- ```js
  import { ArticleComponent } from '../__src__/article.component.mjs';
  ```

  We start by importing the `ArticleComponent`.

- ```js
  describe('ArticleComponent', () => {
    let component;
    let articleAPI;
    let userMessenger;
  ```

  We define a test suite `ArticleComponent`.

- ```js
  let component;
  let articleAPI;
  let userMessenger;

  beforeEach(() => {
    articleAPI = jasmine.createSpyObj('article API', {
      get: Promise.resolve({ id: 1, title: 'first', content: 'article' }),
    });
    userMessenger = jasmine.createSpyObj('userMessenger', ['info', 'error']);
    component = new ArticleComponent(articleAPI, userMessenger);
  });
  ```

  We define some variables that will be available to every test. They get reset before each test in the `beforeEach` Jasmine "hook".

  - The `articleAPI` is using a different `createSpyObj` method overload which allows us to define the default response. In this case we instruct Jasmine to create a spy for the `get` method of the `ArticleAPI` instance and return a Promise resolving to an article.
  - The `userMessenger` is also a spy object and it defines multiple methods for Jasmine to spy on `['info', 'error'].
  - The `component` is reset to a new instance before every test, making each test separate and independent of the rest.

### Test case `when initialized it should call the articleAPI get and assign the result to the article property`

```js
it(`when initialized it should call the articleAPI get and assign the result to the article property`, async () => {
  // arrange
  component.articleId = 1;
  // act
  await component.afterComponentInitialize();
  // assert
  expect(articleAPI.get).toHaveBeenCalledOnceWith(1);
  expect(component.article)
    .toEqual(jasmine.objectContaining({ id: 1 }));
});
```

In the above test case we provide the component with an article id and call the `afterComponentInitialize` method, simulating what a framework will do. In the assertion part, we make sure that the `get` has been called with the expected `id`, and the article returned is an object that contains the `id: 1` in it. We set the `id: 1, title: ...` in the default response for `get` in the `beforeEach` above and not defining it in the test itself.
