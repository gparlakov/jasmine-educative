# Unit Testing classes

In this lesson, we'll look into the difference between testing classes vs testing functions.

In everyday work, we often need to deal with classes ([MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)). Some examples include:

- A Node.js API endpoint handler (server-side).
- A SPA Component class (client-side).

These often include dependencies injected in the constructor and used throughout the methods in the class instance.

We'll look into a class with one dependency and one method that uses that dependency.

## The Article class

What follows is a very simplified example of a class that handles deleting articles in a browser application. It will accept some input and make a request to a server API if conditions are met.

//code

## Class breakdown

The `ArticleDelete` class is relies on a `ArticleAPI` class to make a `DELETE /api/article/:id` call if conditions are met.

- `ArticleAPI` is a class that implements the server API call. _It is empty as that's outside of the current lesson scope, and we'll be mocking its responses for the tests._
- `ArticleDelete` is the main class:

  - ```js
    import { ArticleAPI } from './article-api.mjs';
    ```

    This line imports the ArticleAPI dependency from the adjacent module in the current folder `article-api.mjs`.

  - ```js
    export class ArticleDelete {
    ```

    This line exports the class to be used in other modules.

  - ```js
      /** @type {ArticleAPI} */
      articleAPI;

      /**
       * @param { ArticleAPI } article the article api
       */
      constructor(articleApi) {
        this.articleAPI = articleApi;
      }
    ```

    These lines are the declaration of the `articleAPI` property and populating it in the `constructor`. In other words, constructing an instance of the `ArticleDelete` class requires an instance of the `ArticleAPI` class.

  - ```js
      delete(a) {
        if (a != null && a.id != null) {
          this.articleAPI.delete(a.id);
          return `article deleted: "${a.title}"`;
        }

        return 'no article to delete';
      }
    ```

    This `delete` method will only delete an article that has an `id`. Otherwise will inform the caller of the issue.

## Test breakdown

Looking at the `spec/article-delete.spec.mjs` file we have:

- ```js
  import { ArticleDelete } from '../__src__/article-delete.mjs';

  describe('ArticleDelete', () => {
  ```

  Here we start with `import`ing the `ArticleDelete` class and declaring a test suite for it `describe('ArticleDelete', () => {`

- ```js
  let article;
  let articleAPI;

  beforeEach(() => {
    articleAPI = jasmine.createSpyObj('article API', ['delete']);
    article = new ArticleDelete(articleAPI);
  });
  ```

  Knowing that we need an instance of the `ArticleAPI` we create a spy object with a spy on the `delete` method as that's the only method we use in the logic of the `ArticleDelete` class. Then on the next line, we instantiate an `ArticleDelete` instance. These two instances will get renewed `beforeEach` test so that each test executes in isolation from the others and no one test influences the others.

- ```js
  it(`should call the articleAPI delete and return the deleted article title`, () => {
    // arrange
    // act
    const result = article.delete({ id: 1, title: 'the first article' });
    // assert
    expect(articleAPI.delete).toHaveBeenCalledOnceWith(1);
    expect(result).toEqual('article deleted: "the first article"');
  });
  ```

  In the first test, we run the `article.delete` passing in the expected article object with an `id` and a `title`. Then, we assert that the dependency's `delete` method has been called with the argument expected (`1`) and the result is the expected string (`'article deleted: "the first article"'`).

- ```js
  it(`should return no article to delete when that's the case`, () => {
    // arrange
    // act
    const result = article.delete();
    // assert
    expect(result).toEqual('no article to delete');
  });
  ```

  In the second test, we make sure that when the `delete` method is called without an article, it will return the expected string - `'no article to delete'`.

## Exercise

For this exercise, we'll use the `src/article-create.mjs` in the code playground below. The `ArticleCreate` class is very similar to `ArticleDelete` with the difference being the `create` method:

- ```js
  create(title, content) {
    if (typeof title === 'string' && typeof content === 'string') {
      this.articleAPI.create(title, content);
      return `article created: "${title}" with content "${content}"`;
    }

    return `expected string title and content but received title: "${title}" content: "${content}"`;
  }
  ```

  It takes 2 parameters: `title` and `content` to create the article. And it invokes the `ArticleAPI`'s `create` method. The returned strings confirm the creation of the article or inform of an error.

Let's create the 2 specs for the above logic:

- When called with a title and content it invokes the `ArticleAPI`'s method `create`.
- When called without a title or content, it returns an error explanation.

// code

Show Hint for `should call the articleAPI create and return the created article title and content`

```js
it(`should call the articleAPI create and return the created article title and content`, () => {
  // arrange
  // act
  const result = article.create('the first article', 'some content here');
  // assert
  expect(articleAPI.create).toHaveBeenCalledOnceWith('the first article', 'some content here');
  expect(result).toEqual('article created: "the first article" with content "some content here"');
});
```

Show Hint for `should return what was expected and what was received when missing parameters or not string`

```js
it(`should return what was expected and what was received when missing parameters or not string`, () => {
  // arrange
  // act
  const result = article.create();
  // assert
  expect(result).toEqual('expected string title and content but recived title: "undefined" content: "undefined"');
});
```
