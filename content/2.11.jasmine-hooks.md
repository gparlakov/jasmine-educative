# How to Perform an Action Before and After Each Test

In this lesson, we'll look into using Jasmine hooks to perform actions before or after tests.

// TAGS
beforeEach
afterEach
Jasmine hooks
// end tags

In the previous lesson, we saw that there was a clock install and uninstall actions that were done as part of the spec:

```js
it('should return 7 for a date 7 days ago', () => {
    const clock = jasmine.clock();
    ... // test code skipped

    clock.uninstall();
});
```

That logic is not a part of the test. It's also repeated verbatim for each test. We can do better.

## Jasmine hooks

It turns out there are a few functions we can call and let Jasmine know that we'd like it to perform a certain action before each test or after each test. Let's see how that might look like in the code playground below. _Notice the `spec/days-ago.spec.mjs` file._

// code

## Breakdown

Looking at `spec/days-ago.spec.mjs` and the highlighted lines - 5 through 13 - we can see an example of using the [`beforeEach`](https://jasmine.github.io/api/edge/global.html#beforeEach) and [`afterEach`](https://jasmine.github.io/api/edge/global.html#afterEach).

- ```js
  let clock;
  ```

  We declare a variable that is accessible from all specs. That's because it's declared inside the `describe` callback function scope, and any `it` function has access to it via JavaScript's awesome feature: [Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures).

- ```js
  beforeEach(() => {
    clock = jasmine.clock();
  });
  ```

  We call `beforeEach` passing in a callback/function that does the setup - installing the clock and keeping a reference to that in the `clock` variable.

- ```js
  afterEach(() => {
    clock.uninstall();
  });
  ```

  In an `afterEach` call, we tear down the clock to keep the global scope clean.

## `beforeAll` and `afterAll`

There are two more hooks Jasmine exposes

- The `beforeAll` hook runs once per `describe` suite before any of the specs in that suite.
- The `afterAll` hook runs once per `describe` suite after all of the specs in that suite.

## The official example

At the [Setup and Teardown](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite#section-Setup_and_Teardown) part of the Jasmine getting started guide you can see an example of all the above hooks aka global functions being used.

## Exercise

Let's use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` and repeat the exercise from the previous lesson.

Add tests for the `daysUntil` function in the `spec/days-until.mjs` file below:

// code

Hint for setting up Jasmine clock

```js
let clock;

beforeEach(() => {
  clock = jasmine.clock();
});

afterEach(() => {
  clock.uninstall();
});
```

Show Hint for the specs

```js

it('should return 5 for a date 5 days in the future', () => {
  // arrange
  clock.mockDate(new Date(2021, 8, 10));

  // act
  const until = daysUntil(new Date(2021, 8, 15));

  // assert
  expect(until).toBe(5);
});

it('should return 5 for a date 5 and 1/4 days in the future', () => {
  // arrange
  clock.mockDate(new Date(2021, 8, 10));

  // act
  const until = daysUntil(new Date(2021, 8, 15, 8, 0, 0));

  // assert
  expect(until).toBe(5);
});

it('should return 5 for a date 4 and 3/4 days in the future', () => {
  // arrange
  clock.mockDate(new Date(2021, 8, 10));

  // act
  const until = daysUntil(new Date(2021, 8, 14, 18, 0, 0));

  // assert
  expect(until).toBe(5);
});
```
