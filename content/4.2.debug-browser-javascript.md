# How to Debug Browser-Javascript Tests

When running the tests for our browser application with Jasmine, we have a slightly different approach to debugging. There is the good old `console.log` as well as the browser developer tools. In this lesson, we'll look at how to set up logging out to the node.js console, what's getting logged in the browser console, and how to start a debugging session with Jasmine using the browser developer tools.

#debug, #javascript, #browser

## Using log to console

At the time of writing of this course, using `jasmine-browser-runner runSpecs` does not output the `console.log`-s to the terminal (the nodejs process) because the tests are executed in the browser environment. If that browser is headless, then there is no chance to see the logs.

There is a way to set up a reporter for the `jasmine-browser-runner` so that the logs are shown on the terminal. (based on this Jasmine issue response https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-browser-runner/issues/9#issuecomment-933608524)
See the `spec/helpers/logs.js` in the code playground below. It will replace the `console.log` function with a custom one (by using `spyOn` :)) and store the arguments of each `console.log` in an array `logs` and `afterEach` spec will store the `logs` in the spec context for `spec/support/reporter.js` to use. Since the reporter runs in the context of the node.js process it can easily call `console.log` and result in the output showing on the terminal. That's exactly what it does.

_If all this sounds too complicated - rest assured there is another way shown below "How to use browser dev tools"._

// code

Running this should yield the `--- got article {...}` for each test because that's getting logged out in the `afterComponentInitialize` method. Go ahead and add additional logging to see it appear in the terminal.

_There is a dead-spot for this method - it will not log out before the tests have begun. So if you use `console.log` in the helpers for example - that will not show in the terminal._

## How to use browser dev tools

There is another way, that's not reliant on custom reporters but instead uses the robust and proven browser developer tools. To use that we need to start `jasmine-browser-runner serve --port=9876`. That will serve the app and tests scripts (script modules) and allow a browser to display them by visiting `localhost:9876`. So in the code playground below hit Run and then you'll be able to open a browser and load that addresses just below the code playground (_If you run and debug locally on your machine then use localhost:9876_).

Use the playground below and see the step-by-step demo video for details (_video is for local debug but the only difference is the address in the address bar of the browser_).

## Exercise

- debug and find the issue in the following set of mjs tests
- again with the name but this time it's the first component
- TK think of other tasks based on getting all the previous code in one place and going over it
- TK may be an exception getting thrown...
- debug the promise getting resolved but the test fails
