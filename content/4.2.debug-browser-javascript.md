# How to Debug Browser-Javascript Tests

When running the tests for our browser application with Jasmine we have a bit different approach to debugging. There is the good old console.log as well as the browser developer tools. In this lesson we'll take a look at how to setup logging out to the nodejs console what's getting logged in the browser console, as well as how to start a debugging session with Jasmine using the browser developer tools.

#debug, #javascript, #browser

console log can be setup like this (based on this Jasmine issue response https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-browser-runner/issues/9#issuecomment-933608524)

So we get this when we set it up:

// code

## How to use browser dev tools

start `jasmine-browser-runner serve --port=9876` and give it a port to listen to

Now you can just open a browser and load that address just below the code playground (localhost when debugging locally).

Use the playground below and see the step by step demo video for details.
