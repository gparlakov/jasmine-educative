## The problem

Having the code and its tests in the same file feels a bit uncomfortable. We don't want our users to see the console logs of our tests. Also - the test code is not beneficial to the users, so let's not have them download and run it.

## Jasmine

It turns out that its beneficial to have a tool that:

- finds **all test** files (also known as spec files)
- **runs** the tests
- **reports** on the result - ok/fail/skip

One such tool is [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).

Run the code below to see an example of what Jasmine outputs.

## Breakdown

- The `jasmine.json` file in the `spec/support` folder configures Jasmine:
  - The `src` is the folder to search for spec files.
  - The `"**/*[sS]pec.js"` is the [glob pattern](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>) to match files and recognize them as tests, also know as `spec` files. This pattern can be translated to: "Hey, Jasmine, look for all files in the `src` folder that have names ending on `spec.js` or `Spec.js` and run the tests in them.". The result is that Jasmine will run `src/my.spec.js` and `src/deep/nested/another.spec.js`, and  skip `src/my.function.js`.
- Spec files:
  - File `src/my-first.spec.js`.
  - File `src/deep/nested/another.spec.js` - demonstrates the deep nesting still matches the pattern.
- Other files.
  - File `src/my-function.js` - not matching the spec pattern, so it's skipped.

## Spec file

A spec file generally consists of:

- A `describe` container that names and holds a section of our test cases. It's not unlike namespaces/modules in Node.js.
- An `it` container that names and holds the implementation of a single test case.

Looking at `src/my-first.spec.js`, the `describe` is a function that takes 2 parameters:

- name - `'My first test'`
- function callback which will house the test cases
- ![describe params image missing](/udata/zOMZdMG7zbw/what-is-describe.png)

An `it` is a single test case. It's a function that takes 2 parameters:

- Name - in this case `'should run fine'`.
- Function - the test case implementation in the form of a function. In this case, an arrow function that calls the `expect` function from `Jasmine`.
- ![it params image missing](/udata/X11OQQ9znDM/lesson-2.2-what-is-it.png)
- Finally, the test case itself is only one `expect`-ation call which translates to "Make sure the string `fine` is equal to the string `fine`."

_All this is just a demonstration test run. In reality, each test case will likely contain more logic._

## Run

Running the above code should yield the following:

```sh
Started
..

2 specs, 0 failures
```

## Experiment

- Try changing the string on one side of the `expect` (expectation) and run the specs (for example `expect('fsine').toEqual('fine');`. Notice now the **failing** test is reported in more **details**.
- Try adding one more `it` test. For example:

  - ```js
    it('my second test', () => {
       expect('a string with spaces'.split(' ')).toEqual(['a', 'string', 'with', 'spaces'])
    });
    ```
