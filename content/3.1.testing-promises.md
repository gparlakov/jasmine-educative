# Unit Testing Promise-s using async and await

\- Promise-s are used all over Javascript

\- let's see how they can be tested using `async` and `await`


In everyday work, we often need to deal with Promises ([MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)). Jasmine allows for a straightforward way of testing these using `async` and `await` ([MDN artcle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function))

## The ArticleDelete class

What follows is a very simplified example of a class that handles deleting articles in a browser application. It will accept some input and make a request to a server API if conditions are met.

> For this lesson, the ArticleAPI methods are considered returning `Promise`-s. So the `delete` method returns a `Promise`.

Run the code playground below and see the breakdown below.

## ArticleDelete class breakdown
The `ArticeDelete` class is relying on a `ArticleAPI` class to make a `DELETE /api/article/:id` call if conditions are met.

- `ArticleAPI` is a class that would implement the server API call. _It is empty as that's outside of the current lesson scope, and we'll be mocking its responses for the tests_
- `ArticleDlete` is the main class
  - ```js
    import { ArticleAPI } from './article-api.mjs';
    ```
    importing the ArticleAPI dependency from the adjacent module in the current folder `article-api.mjs`

  - ```js
    export class ArticleDelete {
    ```
    exporting the class to be used in other modules
  - ```js
      /** @type {ArticleAPI} */
      articleAPI;

      /**
       * @param { ArticleAPI } article the article api
       */
      constructor(articleApi) {
        this.articleAPI = articleApi;
      }
    ```
    declaring the `articleAPI` class instance property and populating it when an instance of the class gets constructed. In other words,  constructing an instance of the `ArticleDelete` class will require an instance of `ArticleAPI` class.
  - ```js
      async delete(a) {
        if (a != null && a.id != null) {
          try {
            await this.articleAPI.delete(a.id);
            return `article deleted: "${a.title}"`;
          } catch(e) {
            //... skipped
          }
        }

        return 'no article to delete';
      }
    ```
    calls the ArticleAPI `delete` method and `await`s its response then returns the positive result. The `try catch` block wraps this logic. So if the `delete` method returns a promise that gets rejected the `catch` will get invoked.
    > `create` is an [asyncronous method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)
    > i.e. we can use the `await` keyword to wait for a promise resolution (or rejection) before continuing with the logic

  - ```js
    catch (e) {
      if (e && e.status === 404) {
        return `It looks like article "${a.title}" has alreay been deleted`;
      }
      return `Unknown error trying to delete "${a.title}". Please try again.`;
    }
    ```
    the `catch` logic
      - when the response has a status of 404 (Not found), we'll inform the caller (of the method) that this article has already been deleted
      - otherwise, inform the caller that there was an issue with deleting this article

## Test breakdown

Looking at the `spec/article-delete.spec.mjs` file we have:
 - ```js
   import { ArticleDelete } from '../__src__/article-delete.mjs';

   describe('ArticleDelete', () => {
   ```
   we start with `import`ing the `ArticleDelete` class and declaring a test suite for it `describe('ArticleDelete', () => {`
 - ```js
   let article;
   let articleAPI;

   beforeEach(() => {
     articleAPI = jasmine.createSpyObj('article API', ['delete']);
     article = new ArticleDelete(articleAPI);
   });
   ```
   knowing that we need an instance of the `ArticleAPI` we create a spy object with a spy on the `delete` method as that's the only method we use in the logic of the `ArticleDelete` class. Then in the next line, we instantiate an `ArticleDelete` instance. These two instances will get renewed `beforeEach` test so that each test executes in isolation from the others and no one test influences the others.

### Green path breakdown

In the test case `should call the articleAPI delete and return the deleted article title` we focus on the so-called "green path" test AKA "happy path" [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path). That is testing for the case that the method receives what it expects and works as intended.
- ```js
  it(`should call the articleAPI delete and return the deleted article title`, async () => {
  ```
  notice the second parameter of `it` is an async [function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function). Jasmine knows what to do with such functions. Essentially, this function returns a `Promise`, and Jasmine waits for it to get resolved. And the function itself will wait for any `await ...` expressions to get resolved too.
- ```js
  // arrange
  articleAPI.delete.and.returnValue(Promise.resolve({id: 1}));
  ```
  using the mocking capabilities, we make sure that when the `delete` method of the `ArticleAPI` gets called, it returns a `Promise`. `Promise.resolve` returns a `Promise` that is resolved with the specified result - in this case `{id: 1}`.
- ```js
  // act
  const result = await article.delete({ id: 1, title: 'the first article' });
  ```
  then, we call the `delete` method and `await` its response to get resolved
- ```js
  // assert
  expect(articleAPI.delete).toHaveBeenCalledOnceWith(1);
  expect(result).toEqual('article deleted: "the first article"');
  });
  ```
  finally, we assert that the `delete` has been called and the `result` is as expected

### 404 error test breakdown
In the test case `when the articleAPI delete returns status 404 it should return - already been deleted`, we'll make sure the behavior of the `ArticleDelete.delete` method is as expected for the case that a `404 Not found` is returned from the server.

- ```js
  it(`when the articleAPI delete returns status 404 it should return - already been deleted`, async () => {
  ```
  notice the second parameter of `it` is an async [function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function), taking advantage of Jasmine's Promise handling capability.
- ```js
  // arrange
  articleAPI.delete.and.returnValue(Promise.reject({status: 404, message: 'not found'}));
  ```
  using the mocking capabilities, we make sure that when the `delete` method of the `ArticleAPI` gets called, it returns a `Promise`. `Promise.reject` returns a `Promise` that is rejected with the specified result - in this case `{status: 404, message: 'not found'}`.

  _Note: This is just an example of how a rejected Promise might look like ([axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/handling_errors)). Depending on the specific API or library used the rejection might not happen on a 404_
- ```js
  // act
  const result = await article.delete({ id: 1, title: 'the first article' });
  ```
  then, we call the `delete` method and `await` its response to get resolved
- ```js
  // assert
  expect(result).toEqual('It looks like article "the first article" has alreay been deleted');
  ```
  finally, we assert that the `delete` gets called and the `result` is as expected for the 404 case

## Exercise

For this exercise, we'll focus on `src/article-create.mjs` in the code playground below. The `ArticleCreate` class is very similar to `ArticleDelete`, with the main difference being the `create` method:
- ```js
  async create(title, content) {
    if (typeof title === 'string' && typeof content === 'string') {
      try {
        await this.articleAPI.create(title, content);
        return `article created: "${title}" with content "${content}"`;
      } catch (e) {
        if (e && e.status === 409) {
          return `it appears that an article with that title "${title}" already exists`
        }

        return `failed creating article ${title} - please try again later`
      }
    }

    return `expected string title and content but recived title: "${title}" content: "${content}"`;
  }
  ```
  - it is an `async`-chronous method
  - it takes two parameters: `title` and `content` to create the article, and it invokes the `ArticleAPI`'s `create` method.
  - the returned strings confirm the creation of the article or inform of an error.
  - in the case of a status [409 Conflict](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/409), it advises there is an article with such a title already

Let's create the three specs for the above logic:
 - when called with title and content, it invokes the `ArticleAPI`'s method `create`
 - when the API returns a 409 Conflict, it should advise the caller such a title already exists
 - when called without a title or content, it returns an error explanation.

>Note: the tests for `ArticleDelete` are part of the code playground too.

Show Hint for `should call the articleAPI create and return the created article title and content`

  ```js
  it(`should call the articleAPI create and return the created article title and content`, async () => {
    // arrange
    articleAPI.create.and.returnValue(Promise.resolve({id: 1}));
    // act
    const res = await article.create('My new title', `## Heading

    Paragraph 1 with some content

    ## heading 2

    Paragraph 2 with some more content
    `);
    // assert
    expect(res).toEqual(`article created: "My new title" with content "## Heading

    Paragraph 1 with some content

    ## heading 2

    Paragraph 2 with some more content
    "`)
  });
  ```

    // assert
    expect(res).toEqual(`it appears that an article with that title "My new title" already exists`)
  });
  ```
Show Hint for `should return what was expected and what was received when missing parameters or not string`
  ```js
  it(`should return what was expected and what was received when missing parameters or not string`, async () => {
    // arrange
    // act
    const result = await article.create();
    // assert
    expect(result).toEqual('expected string title and content but recived title: "undefined" content: "undefined"');
  });
