# How to Test Functions Depending on Date-s

In this lesson, we'll look into testing functions that depend on the date and time directly. For the browser and Node.js context.

When our applications deal with `Date`s we need to be able to test that interaction. One such way is using `jasmine.clock`.

Let's see an example of a function using `Date` to calculate how many days ago a date was.

## The Date-dependent function

Looking at the `daysAgo` function logic in `src/days-ago.mjs` line by line:

- ```js
  const nowMilliseconds = Date.now();
  ```

  It starts with the current date in milliseconds. That's how many milliseconds have elapsed since 1 January 1970 UTC.

- ```js
  const dateMilliseconds = date.valueOf();
  ```

  This line taking the passed-in date value in milliseconds so they are both in comparable units - milliseconds.

- ```js
  const agoMilliseconds = nowMilliseconds - dateMilliseconds;
  ```

  This line subtracts `date` from `now` and gets the difference in milliseconds.

- ```js
  const millisecondsInADay = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;
  ```

  This line calculates how many milliseconds in a day. 1000 ms in a second \* 60 seconds in a minute \* 60 minutes in an hour \* 24 hours in a day.

- ```js
  const daysAgo = agoMilliseconds / millisecondsInADay;
  ```

  This line divides the milliseconds ago with the milliseconds in a day getting how many days ago the date was

- ```js
  return Math.round(daysAgo);
  ```

  This line rounds the `daysAgo` number to the nearest integer because we don't want to get `This date was 7.1430499282 days ago` but `This date was 7 days ago`.

## Testing the Date-dependent function

Let's run that using the code playground below and break the test down after.

// code

## Breakdown

Looking at `spec/days-ago.spec.mjs` and the first test `'should return 7 for a date 7 days ago'`s logic line-by-line:

- ```js
  const clock = jasmine.clock();
  ```

  This line gets an instance of the [Clock](https://jasmine.github.io/api/2.6/Clock.html).

- ```js
  clock.install().mockDate(new Date(2021, 8, 10));
  ```

  This installs that (aka activate it) and sets a specific date - Sep 10, 2021.
  > Note: the months in the Date constructor begin from 0 e.g.
  >
  > - 0 - Jan, 1 - Feb ... **8 - Sep**

- ```js
  // act
  const ago = daysAgo(new Date(2021, 8, 3));
  ```

  This line create a `Date` instance for Sep 3, 2021 `new Date(2021, 8, 3)`. Now we have 2 dates that are 7 days apart - Sep 10 and Sep 3 and we get the result from applying the function on Sep 3, 2021 - `ago`.

- ```js
  // assert
  expect(ago).toBe(7);
  ```

  Our assertion checks that `ago` is indeed 7.

- ```js
  clock.uninstall();
  ```

  We need to clean up the installed clock to make sure we don't influence other tests.

  _In the next lesson, we'll talk about how to move such actions and clean up out of the tests themselves._

### The 6 and 3/4 days ago test

In the `'should return 7 for a date 6 and 3/4 days ago'` test we take a date that's 6 and 18 hours ago. The requirement is that we still get 7 as the output for such input.

- ```js
  // act
  const ago = daysAgo(new Date(2021, 8, 3, 6, 0, 0));
  ```

  That's Sep 3, 2021, 6:00:00AM which is 6 days and 18 hours before Sep 10, 2021, 00:00:00 AM.
  - The 0,0,0 is assumed when we skip it in the Date constructor i.e. the following two are equivalent.

  - ```js
    new Date(2021, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0);
    ```

  - ```js
    new Date(2021, 8, 3);
    ```

- ```js
  // assert
  expect(ago).toBe(7);
  ```

  This line asserts the expectation - `ago` is still 7 with a date 6 and 3/4 days ago.

### The 7 and 1/4 days ago test

In the `'should return 7 for a date 7 and 1/4 days ago'` test we take a date that's 7 days and 6 hours ago. The requirement is that we still get 7 as the output for such input.

- ```js
  // act
  const ago = daysAgo(new Date(2021, 8, 2, 18, 0, 0));
  ```

  That's Sep 2, 2021, 6:00:00PM which is 7 days and 6 hours before Sep 10, 2021, 00:00:00 AM.

- ```js
  // assert
  expect(ago).toBe(7);
  ```

  This line asserts the expectation - `ago` is still 7 with a date 7 and 1/4 days ago.

## Exercise

For this exercise, we'll use a very similar function `daysUntil` that calculates how many days until a date in the future. See it in `src/days-until.mjs` below. The only difference is that we calculate the difference from today until the date (while it was reversed previously). Go ahead and exercise - replace the `pending` calls with the logic and expect a hint below.

// code

// hints
Show Hint for `should return 5 for a date 5 days in the future`

```js
  it('should return 5 for a date 5 days in the future', () => {
    // arrange
    const clock = jasmine.clock()
    clock.install().mockDate(new Date(2021, 8, 10));

    // act
    const ago = daysUntil(new Date(2021, 8, 15));

    // assert
    expect(ago).toBe(5);

    clock.uninstall();
  });
```

Show Hint for `should return 5 for a date 4 and 3/4 days in the future`

```js
  it('should return 5 for a date 5 and 1/4 days in the future', () => {
    // arrange
    const clock = jasmine.clock()
    clock.install().mockDate(new Date(2021, 8, 10));

    // act
    const ago = daysUntil(new Date(2021, 8, 15, 6, 0, 0));

    // assert
    expect(ago).toBe(5);

    clock.uninstall();
  });
```

Show Hint for `should return 5 for a date 4 and 3/4 days in the future`

```js
  it('should return 5 for a date 4 and 3/4 days in the future', () => {
    // arrange
    const clock = jasmine.clock()
    clock.install().mockDate(new Date(2021, 8, 10));

    // act
    const ago = daysUntil(new Date(2021, 8, 14, 18, 0, 0));

    // assert
    expect(ago).toBe(5);

    clock.uninstall();
  });
```

// hints end

## Node js and Date

Incidentally, the same code with a bit of different importing of the functions works in the node.js environment. We've included the example from above plus the exercise code in the code playground below - go ahead and try it:
